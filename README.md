# Social Savoring
---
## Overview: 
This Django web app is a recipe creation and social media platform where users can create and share recipes, upload videos/photos, and post their culinary creations online. Other users can explore these posts, rate recipes, leave comments, and even suggest amendments to improve or customize the recipe (similar to a pull request).

## Feed Page:
The home page of the website which includes featured posts from other users and posts from followed users.
- Following section: (left of the home page) lists out all of the profiles you are following. (can hide)
- Featured section: This section is displayed in the center which shows all the current trending recipes and all the newly created recipes from users that are being followed. (displayed as following: Recipe title, recipe image/short video, and (likes count and number of comments))

## Search Page:
This page lets the user filter all recipes based on two fields of categories. These parameters are things like “breakfast”, “lunch”, “dinner”, “snacks”, “dessert”, “healthy”. Tags are the specifics about the recipe that can be searched for. (“vegan”, “gluten free”, “keto”, “kosher”, “vegetarian”, “lent”, “Christmas”, “thanksgiving”, “Hanukah”, etc.)
